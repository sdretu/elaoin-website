kiPas for PlayBook available now!

kiPas is out on AppWorld! http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/67038?lang=en

I changed the name at the last-minute because KIPASS was already used by Kawasaki :-)

As usual, send all your feature requests, bug reports, and questions this way and I’ll reply as quickly as possible.

Regarding cryptographic technologies export restrictions, it looks like the only affected country is France, ironically enough, it is where the app comes from… Let’s hope this won’t take too long…

I wish you all enjoy kiPas!
