OSCream lands on Android

Rejoice, Android Monome fans!

I finally found the time to release a working Beta of OSCream Monome and Monome Arc emulator for Android devices, it works quite well on my Samsung Galaxy S2, but I believe you would need quite a powerful device to run the application, in any case your Android device needs to be capable of running Adobe AIR.

I hope youâ€™ll enjoy it, let me know how it works!
