BB DevCon Amsterdam

I will be at the BlackBerry DevCon in Amsterdam next week!!

I’m very excited about it as it is the first dev conference I’m attending, I have registered to most sessions dealing with Adobe AIR and Web HTML 5 development, I will also attend most of the « Ask the experts » sessions, hoping to get a few clues to improve my apps. So if you will be in Amsterdam for the BB DevCon, just drop a comment :-)

To come back to apps, I hope I will be able to release just a bugfix version of kiPas before DevCon, and this will probably be the last version for PlayBook OS1, the next one will focus on compatibility with OS2, depending on what comes out of DevCon, I’m thinking about revamping the UI completely to abandon Flex… But the main focus for now is performance, I already made good progress, and the gain is really significant, so I will try to port all the cryptographic and hash computation to ANE. In any case, I will post an update for PlayBook OS2 release.

For OSCream, I’m also thinking about ANE to add support for OSC messages over UDP, this would make it easier to connect to OSC clients as most of them communicate over UDP, also, it would allow to connect to them without the need for OSCream Server to forward messages between TCP and UDP.

So stay tuned for updates, and maybe see you at BlackBerry DevCon!
