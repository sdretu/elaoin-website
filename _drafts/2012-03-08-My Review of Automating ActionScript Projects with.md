Best Uses: Intermediate, Novice, Student

Describe Yourself: Developer

I wish I had this book when I first started to code AS3, it gives a good review of some best practices to streamline your development workflow, from basic setup of the IDE (focused on Eclipse/FDT) to automatic compilation, deployment and publishing.
I love the fact that it includes instructions about integration with Source code management and issue tracking, too often these primordial aspects of a developer’s work are completely overlooked.
On the downside, a chapter dealing specifically with PlayBook development would have been welcome since AIR was the primary platform on this device, there are dedicated chapters covering Android and iOS though.
Overall its a great book, giving a concise and complete presentation on the subject, it is accessible (and recommended) to beginners, and more advanced devs will certainly find a handful of good tricks in there.
