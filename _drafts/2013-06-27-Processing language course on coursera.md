I have started to follow several courses on Coursera, one of them is [Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps](https://www.coursera.org/learn/digitalmedia) this is very interesting so far and gives a good deal of information about using the Processing language for multimedia mobile applications.

The course teaches the basics of Processing, which is also used for Arduino programming, and it also gives a head start for coding appealing visual effects. Participants to the course have to submit their apps for peer review, and this blog post is where Iâ€™ll try to link my modest projects.

My first test Processing app can be seen on smugrik.org/processing
