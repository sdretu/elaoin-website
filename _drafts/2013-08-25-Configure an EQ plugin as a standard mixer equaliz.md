Configure an EQ plugin as a standard mixer equalizer section in Ableton Live 9

August 25th, 2013 § Leave a Comment

I am following the Coursera class “Introduction to music production”. In this post, I’ll demonstrate the configuring of an EQ plugin to function like a large format mixing console EQ section, in my DAW, Ableton Live 9, as part of the fifth week assessment.

## What is the mixer EQ section used for

The basic equalizer section of a mixing board channel strip would include the following types of filter.

1. High Pass filter: used to remove noise and rumbles
2. Low shelving filter: boost the bass to have a fuller sound, boost a bit around the 100 Hz frequencies
3. Mid range filters: a boost in mid frequencies can be very obvious and disagreeable, but cutting some of the midrange frequencies helps to attenuate some undesirable resonances
4. High shelving filter: helps to give the focus to one element, brightens the element you want the listener to focus on (eventually lower the other instruments high frequencies)

## How to replicate a standard mixer eq section in Ableton Live 9

In the Coursera materials, the teacher Loudon Stearns gave an example of a commercial mixer that included the following filters:

* a 75 Hz 18db/oct high pass filter
* a 12 KHz high shelving filter
* a mid frequency bell filter varying from 400 Hz to 8 KHz
* a mid frequency bell filter varying from 100 Hz to 2 KHz
* a 80 Hz low shelving filter

In Ableton Live 9, the standard tracks mixer doesn’t have a mixer, so we’ll have to use a plugin, add an “eq eight” plugin to your track, and set it up as shown below.

## Save this standard equalizer setting as a preset

To save the standard equalizer as a preset, simply click the little floppy icon in the top left corner of the equalizer window.

This will create a new preset in the library view, type a name for your preset, and then hit enter.

Now your saved preset appears in the library view.
