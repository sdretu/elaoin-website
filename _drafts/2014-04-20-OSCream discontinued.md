OSCream discontinued

BlackBerry recently announced that the Adobe AIR platform won’t be supported anymore on BB10 in the next update of the OS, BB10.3.

Therefore, it makes no sense for me to keep maintaining OSCream as it is now, maintaining an Adobe AIR app that could only run on Android, especially given the restrictions of the AIR platform (no support for UDP, that’s why OSCream server was required).

So OSCream has already been removed from the Android Play store. It will stay for a bit longer on the BlackBerry AppWorld, but it won’t be upgraded anymore, and obviously it won’t be running on the new BB10.3 OS update.

I’m planning to rewrite it from scratch, under a new name to avoid confusion, the first platform to see this new version will be iOS, then maybe Android.
