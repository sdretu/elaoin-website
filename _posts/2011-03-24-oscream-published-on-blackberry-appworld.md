I did it!

I just finished the submission process for the first version of OSCream for BlackBerry PlayBook. Now waiting for approval from AppWorld.

It has been quite challenging to learn development for a new platform, I had never used Adobe Flex nor ActionScript before, and I really enjoyed it. I hope you’ll enjoy the application too :-)

Shortly, OSCream is intended to be a multi-usage OSC remote controller, ideally something like a lemur. Right now it only supports one simple surface, though very rich in possibility, MN8x8 is in fact a Monome 64 emulator, I have tested it with various Monnome application on MAX and PureData and I’m very happy with the results, I had never had a chance to use a Monome before so this was really all new to me.

Well it’s quite late here so I’ll leave it here for today, I wish OSCream good luck on RIM’s AppWorld and hope it will have many more surfaces to play with in a near future.
