![OSCream 0.3 BETA, Arc4 running Plates](/assets/blog/oscream-0_3_BETA.png)

I have made good progress with the monome arc emulator for OSCream, actually I now have a working BETA.

Some small improvements still need to be made with the UI, also I’m not sure where and how to handle the encoder click (now I have simply put a separate button under the encoder), but the arc is already playable.

In fact it even seems to be working quite good as far as I can tell on the PlayBook Simulator, I have played it with Stretta’s Electric Dharma Wheels, as well as other Arc instrument patches, the screenshot below is running Plates for Arc4.
