Lately I’ve been working extensively at porting an app I was badly missing on the PlayBook: KeePass.

For those not familiar with it, KeePass is a password management tool that allows to generate random passwords, and keep them safe and organized in a securely encrypted database, so you’ll never have to worry about remembering your passwords again.

I named the app kiPas, as it is not affiliated with the original application, the beta version is coming along nicely and I expect a first release by the end of September.

I already have full decrypting of DB done, supporting password and/or key file authentication, and I can finally copy-paste usernames and passwords on the PlayBook, I’ll add editing password entries, and polish the user interface (right now this is a bit ugly) and it will be good for a beta release.
