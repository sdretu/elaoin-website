There is not a lot of improvement in this second Beta release, it is now possible to add groups, and DB creation is on its way, though the functionality is broken now, this update is mainly for users who add older version of DB that were not accepted by KiPass due to a bug in the version check procedure.

Development was frozen for a week since my Dell Inspiron Laptop cpu fan died, and the computer would overheat and stop brutally after 5 minutes of usage. I have now finished to move my dev environment to a new computer and work resumed.

Please tell us what you think of the Beta in the comments, and donâ€™t hesitate to report any bug.

App was updated to 1.0.0
