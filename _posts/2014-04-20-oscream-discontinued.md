BlackBerry recently announced that the Adobe AIR platform won’t be supported anymore on BB10 in the next update of the OS, BB10.3.

Therefore, it makes no sense for me to keep maintaining OSCream as it is now, maintaining an Adobe AIR app that could only run on Android, especially given the restrictions of the AIR platform (no support for UDP, that’s why OSCream server was required).

So OSCream is still available on the Android Play store, as long as Adobe AIR is available there. It will stay for a bit longer on the BlackBerry AppWorld, but it won’t be upgraded anymore, and obviously it won’t be running on the new BB10.3 OS update.
