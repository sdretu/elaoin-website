This is a software MIDI editor for [Mutable Instruments](https://mutable-instruments.net)'s awesome DIY synthesizer, the Shruthi-1.

This stand-alone software was entirely done using MAX 6 software from Cycling74.

It allows edition of all the Shruthi-1 parameters from a single screen through a MIDI connection.

It can send and receive patch data in SYSEX format.

Last but not least, the editor is open-source and the MAX project files can be downloaded from my GitHub.

## Downloads
Download the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/sdretu/Shruthi-1-Editor)

[Download the App package for OSX](/assets/Shruthi-1_Editor.app.zip), unzip and just drag and drop to your Applications folder.
