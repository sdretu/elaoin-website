This is a software MIDI editor for [Mutable Instruments](https://mutable-instruments.net)'s awesome DIY synthesizer-beatbox, the Anushri.

This stand-alone software was entirely done using MAX 6 software from Cycling74.

It allows edition of all the Anushri parameters from a single screen through a MIDI connection, including parameters of the drum synth engine which are not accessible from the Anushri interface.

It also offers an easy access to programmin drum patterns in x0x style.

It can send and receive system data in SYSEX format.

Last but not least, the editor is open-source and the MAX project files can be downloaded from my GitHub.
