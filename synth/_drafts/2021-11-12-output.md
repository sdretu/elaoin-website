![The Output module naked]()

This is a simple output module providing two quarter inch jack outputs with a master level, and a quarter inch jack stereo output for headphone, with a dedicated level. There is a left and right input, all outputs are properly buffered and the headphone amp section should be able to drive high impedance headphones.

This module is based on a circuit by YuSynth: [Output Mixer & CV Panner](http://yusynth.net/Modular/EN/MIXOUT/index.html), but only the outputs part of the original module have been kept: the two buffered outputs, and the headphone amp section.
