![Triple Attenuator Mixer](/assets/synth/3attmix-assembled-pcbs.png)

A simple utility module that can be used as a 3 way mixer, or 3 separate attenuator, or one attenuator and a 2 way mixer.
Eurorack

This is a simple 3 way mixer, with a passive attenuator for each of the three inputs, and a mix output with a main level potentiometer. Each input also has a dedicated output, when a jack is plugged into an output, the corresponding input is removed from the mix, and thus can be used as an independent passive attenuator. Hence this module can be used as a 3 voice mixer, or one passive attenuator and a two voice mixer, or three passive attenuators.
