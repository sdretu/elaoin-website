SOICDIP14 adaptersI originally designed this small SOIC-DIP14 adapter to use LM3046 (available from mouser) as replacement for CA3046.

Of course it can be used to fit any SOIC14 ic into a DIP14 footprint.

This project is open source (CC-by-SA), and boards can be ordered directly from OSHPark, it amounts to about 1$ per chip.

## Build Instructions

You need the two boards for one adapter, the top board holds the SMD, the bottom board holds the pins for the DIP socket
Pins 1,2,6,7,8,9,13,14 go through both boards, pins 3,4,5,10,11,12 go only in the bottom board, theyâ€™re connected to the top through the six small holes in the middle, I use resistor or diode legs for the pins, on OSH, it amounts to a total of 1$ per adapter
